        <li>Sundarbans:</li> <img src="images/Sundarban_Tiger.jpg" alt="Sundarban Tiger">

        <p class="paragraph">The Sundarbans, spanning the delta of the Padma, Meghna, and Brahmaputra rivers in Bangladesh and India, constitute the world's largest mangrove forest. This UNESCO World Heritage Site covers around 10,000 square kilometers, renowned for its unique biodiversity and vital ecological role. The Sundarbans' mangrove ecosystem acts as a natural buffer against coastal erosion and storm surges, featuring an intricate network of tidal waterways and small islands.
        <br><br>
        The region is home to diverse wildlife, including the iconic Bengal tiger, saltwater crocodiles, spotted deer, and various bird species. Human communities inhabit the fringes, relying on the forest for their livelihoods through activities like fishing and honey collection. Conservation challenges, such as habitat loss and climate change impacts, threaten the Sundarbans. Efforts from both Bangladesh and India aim to safeguard this critical ecosystem. The Sundarbans also attract eco-tourists keen to explore its natural beauty, with boat tours offering glimpses of the rich flora and fauna. However, rising sea levels and other climate-related factors underscore the urgent need for sustainable conservation practices to ensure the long-term survival of the Sundarbans and the well-being of its inhabitants.</p>
